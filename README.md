# linux_shell_kit

Random Linux shell stuff.

This repository contains my random Linux shell stuff, including:

- The utility library
- The tools

## The utility library

- `t_util_lib.sh`:
  - Data size conversion (e.g: from gibibytes to bytes)
  - Echo with prefix

## The tools

- `t_proc_info.sh`: Provides brief info of a process by using existed tools (top, lsof...) and displays results in a visual, organized manner.
